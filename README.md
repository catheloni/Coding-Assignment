# Welcome to my Coding Assignment!

A brief overview fo what I did and how to reproduce this:

### Stata
"data_cleaning.do" entails all the stata operations to clean the "airbnb_london_listin.csv". After running this, I saved the data as "airbnb_cleaned.dta", which is the dataset that I continued to work with from then on. I created a histogram and a scatterplot with this data, as outlined in "Stata Operations.do".

### Python
I started out with "airbnb_london_listing.csv". All of the Python code is in one file, namely "Jupyter_Operations.ipynb". This shows first how I cleaned the data and save it as "cleaned_data_python". I then go on using the cleaned data to perform all of the other required task (summary statistics, loops etc.)

### Understanding Folderstructure
I was working in my terminal to change file names, move them etc. My code can be taken from the txt file "folder_structure_terminal".

The ".ipynb_checkpoints" folder can be ignored! It was automatically pushed to GitHub when I pushed my Python documents; I wasn't sure if they do anything so I was afraid to delete it... :)
